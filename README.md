## About

This is a demo of AI chatbot using [Next.js](https://x.com/2co_p/status/1799076368631906451) and [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction). The bot is acting as a bank assistant. It can perform two actions: transfer money and get the current balance.

### Highlights

- Allow the user to change their mind and change previously entered information.
- Allow the user to change their mind and change the action they want to perform.
- Verify the user's account before performing an action.
